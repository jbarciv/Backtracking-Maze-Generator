# Recursive VS Iterative Dynamic Backtracking Maze Generator with C++ 

## Description

The next respository has two C++ programs. Both implement a Dynamic Maze Generator with a ramdomized version of the depth-first search algorithm (for more information read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_division_method). One program uses a recursive method and the other an iterative method.

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jbarciv/Recursividad-PS/
```
Change your directory to the one where you have clone the repository. Choose between the Iterative or Recursive program and move to this folder finally just type:
```
$ make
```
you will be using the Makefile for compiling and linking all the .cpp files.
For running the program you have some options (we'll be using the recursive program
#### The program asks you the dimensions for the maze:
```
$ ./Maze_Recursive
```
