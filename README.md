# Recursive VS Iterative Dynamic Backtracking Maze Generator with C++
***
## Description
***
The next respository has two C++ programs. Both implement a Dynamic Maze Generator with a ramdomized version of the depth-first search algorithm (for more information read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_division_method). One program uses a recursive method and the other one an iterative.

## Installation
***
A little intro about the installation. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jbarciv/Recursividad-PS/
```
Then change your directory to the one where you have clone the repository and justa type:
```
make
```
you will be using the Makefile for compiling and linking all the .cpp files.
