# A Recursive VS Iterative Dynamic Backtracking Maze Generator with C++
***
## Description
***
The next respository has two C++ programs. Both implement a Dynamic Maze Generator with a ramdomized version of the depth-first search algorithm (read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_division_method). One program uses a recursive method and the other one an iterative.
